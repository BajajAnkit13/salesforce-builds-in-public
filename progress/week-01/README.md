# Week 01 – Salesforce Development Foundations & Project Setup

## Objective
Build a **strong Salesforce development foundation** and set up a **clean, scalable project structure** that can evolve week by week.

This week focuses on **understanding the platform and preparing the ground** for real-world development.

---

## Why Week 01 Matters
Jumping straight into features without structure leads to:
- Tight coupling
- Hard-to-test code
- Messy repositories

Week 01 ensures:
- Clear project vision
- Professional GitHub structure
- Development environment ready for scale

---

## What Was Done

### 1 Salesforce Development Fundamentals
- Apex basics and execution context
- Data types, collections, and control flow
- Governor limits & bulkification concepts
- SOQL & DML fundamentals

---

### 2 Development Environment Setup
- Salesforce DX project setup
- VS Code configuration
- Prettier & Apex formatting
- Git + GitHub integration

---

### 3 Project Architecture Planning
Defined the **Customer Account Lifecycle Management System** with:
- Clear business goals
- Modular architecture approach
- Future extensibility in mind

📁Architecture documentation:
architecture/
├── project-goal.md
├── system-overview.md
├── data-model.md
└── flow-diagrams.md

---

### 4 GitHub Repository Structure
Established a **professional repo layout**:
CustomerAccountLifecycleMgmt
├── force-app
├── architecture
├── progress
└── README.md

---

## Outcomes Achieved
- Solid Salesforce development fundamentals
- Clean GitHub repo aligned with industry standards
- Clear roadmap for incremental feature delivery
- Ready foundation for backend feature development

---

## Next Week (Week 02 Preview)
- Implement core backend logic
- Apply SOQL, DML, and Apex patterns
- Build a real business use case (Risk Assessment Engine)

---

## Key Takeaway
Strong systems are built on **intentional foundations**, not rushed features.
