# Salesforce Builds in Public

Core Project: Customer Account Lifecycle Management System

This repository documents my Salesforce development practice journey.

I work on Apex, Lightning Web Components, and integration use cases during the week and share weekly implementation learnings on LinkedIn. The goal is to build strong fundamentals first and gradually progress toward scalable, production-ready Salesforce patterns.

## Project Vision

This repository documents an evolving Salesforce system built incrementally as new development and integration concepts are learned and applied.

## Focus Areas

This repository emphasizes both **Salesforce platform skills** and **core software engineering principles**, including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
  Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism are applied through Apex classes, interfaces, and handler frameworks

- **Apex Development:**  
  Triggers, trigger handler patterns, batch & async processing, exception handling, and bulkification

- **Lightning Web Components (LWC):**  
  Component-based UI design, reusability, and separation of concerns

- **SOQL & Performance:**  
  Governor-limit-safe queries, selective filters, and scalable data access patterns

- **Integrations:**  
  REST API callouts using Named Credentials, external services, and error handling

- **Test-Driven Development:**  
  Meaningful test classes with 90%+ coverage focusing on behaviour, not just lines of code

## Objective

To build Salesforce solutions that are:
- Cleanly designed using OOP principles  
- Scalable and maintainable  
- Aligned with real-world business use cases  
- Easy to understand, test, and extend  

This is a living repository that evolves weekly as complexity increases.
