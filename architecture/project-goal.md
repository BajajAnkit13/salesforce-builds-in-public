# Project Goal & Vision

**Project Name:** Customer Account Lifecycle Management System

---

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a realistic, end-to-end Salesforce system that evolves incrementally as new Salesforce development and integration concepts are learned.

Instead of creating isolated demos or one-off assignments, this project is designed to simulate how real Salesforce applications grow in production environments—feature by feature, driven by business requirements and technical learning.

## Project Description

The Customer Account Lifecycle Management System focuses on managing and enhancing the Account lifecycle using Salesforce development best practices.

The system starts with strong backend foundations such as object-oriented Apex design, bulk-safe SOQL and DML, and testable business logic. Over time, it expands to include user-facing components, automation for scale, external integrations, and enterprise-grade security controls.

Each enhancement is introduced incrementally and mapped to specific Salesforce development topics, allowing the system to grow organically rather than being built all at once.

## What I Am Trying to Achieve

Through this project, I aim to:

- Strengthen Salesforce development fundamentals through hands-on implementation  
- Apply object-oriented principles to design clean, scalable, and testable Apex code  
- Write bulk-safe SOQL and DML suitable for production environments  
- Develop the ability to design systems that scale with data volume and business complexity  
- Build the habit of incremental system enhancement instead of isolated coding exercises  
- Maintain a public, evolving portfolio that demonstrates consistency and engineering thinking  
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs as the system evolves over time  

This project also serves as a learning-in-public initiative, promoting accountability, reflection, and continuous improvement through weekly progress updates.

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this project, the outcome will be a well-documented Salesforce application that reflects practical development experience across the Salesforce platform.

The project acts as a living portfolio, demonstrating not just knowledge of Salesforce tools, but the ability to design, extend, and maintain a scalable system over time.
